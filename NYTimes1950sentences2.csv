And hence the claim that by 1970 the Soviet Union will rank first in the world both for physical volume of production and production per head of population should not be ig nored. However he emphasized that the possible Soviet superiority over the United States in total volume of industrial production within about ten years apparently does not take into account the marked superiority of United States housing and consumer goods in general or the much wider variety of American goods. He acknowledged that there had clearly been substantial improvements in housing food and clothing in recent years. But he doubted that even with the 50 per cent increase in light industry and consumer goods envisaged by the Seven Year Plan the Soviet Union could attain the living standards of the United States by 1970 while Soviet industry concentrated on heavy industry and American standards continued to rise.However Dr. Galloway stressed the advances already being made in the Soviet Union through production research and automation.In the light of these advances.Dr. Galloway said the United States Britain and other Western countries can o.ily meet the etruienge whicn Russia s tremendously vital industries now present by providing every assistance and every incentive to their own industries to raise productivity by the continuous improvement of production techniques and equipment. In the widest context he continued this will demand an extensive reappraisal of the present situation by governments scientists engineers workers and workers representatives.

115076874_1.txt,But by the first half of 1960 while we produced much more than in 1953 our factories and farms and other productive resources were 10 to 15 per cent idle.For the entire seven year period since early 1953 the low growth rate has meant about 15 million man years less employment and at least 200 billion less total national production than we should have enjoyed.Today the new technology and the new automation are advancing at an accelerating rate so far above past rates that many who are not given to exaggeration refer to the trends as a second industrial revolution. If our over all economic growth rate in the years ahead should be no more rapid than during the past seven years and if public and private spending should grow as slowly we would by 1964 face the devastating burden of a true level of unemployment of 9 or 10 per cent of the civilian labor force and an over all slack in the use of productive resources of more than 16 per cent.In that event for the entire five year period from the beginning of 1960 to the end of 1864 we would suffer about 18 million man years of excessive unemployment and forfeit about 350 billion in total national production.During the years immediately ahead we in the United States have room and to spare for a vast expansion of business investment in plant and tools the fundamental source of our economic progress for a vast expansion in private living standards and simultaneously for a vast expansion of public programs.

Look Ma no hands is the theme song of the automated factory line.Machines pass parts to one another give orders to one another inspect their own product correct their own mistakes and the only limit on how much work can be automated is whether an industry has enough customers and enough standardization of product design to justify the cost of automating.Some analysts consider the whole process a second Industrial revolution with all the potentiality for social upheaval that marked the birth of the factory a century and a half ago.Others insist it is just another step in industry s progress toward greater efficiency no different in its basic attributes from any of the technological A.

The automatically controlled machine of tomorrow a report by the council says will be guided without human intervention in response to a series of instructions previously recorded in numerical code on such media as cards paper tape magnetic tape or film. Behind Automatic Control MACHINE THAT DIKKCTS MACHINES The electronic memory unit of this elaborate device stores up instructions then sets drills in action to balance crankshafts accurately at the Ford Motor Company s Cleveland engine plant.The device the first in use in the automotive industry receives impulses from a scanning screen at the right finds how much a crankshaft is out of balance and where and then grinds them to within a fraction of perfect balance.The principle behind automatic control or automatic self regulation is known as the feedback according to the council.This is the situation when information about the output at one stage of a process is returned or fed back to an earlier stage so as to influence its action and hence to change the output itself. An example of automatic control embodying this principle is the thermostat which notes the temperature on a thermometer and controls fuel input to a boiler or a furnace.It operates through a relay actuated by thermal conduction or convection which functions1 to establish and maintain a desired temperature by automatic manipulation of the fuel control.

Burens company vice president and general manager of the switchgear and control department jointly emphasized at the dedicatory ceremonies the long range optimism of industrial leaders that the tuend toward automation would produce a stronger economy with more jobs and greater prosperity. As we have seen here today Dr. Rader declared this leads to more jobs in producing this type of equipment and to better jobs in its utilization on production lines since it relieves man of more monotonous chores and frees him for more creative andl interesting work. Walter Reuther president of the United Auto Workers and of the Congress of Industrial Organizations some months ago criticized President Eisenhower s annual economic report as having failed to give an analysis of the potential of automation with regard to temporary job dislocations and planning essential to meet the problems of the new technology.Mr. Reuther then cited as an example of automation problems the fact that forty one workers were now required on one production line turning out 154 engine blocks an hour a job formerly requiring 117 men to perform.

An example of automatic control embodying this principle is the thermostat which notes the temperature on a thermometer and controls fuel input to a boiler or a furnace.It operates through a relay actuated by thermal conduction or convection which functions1 to establish and maintain a desired temperature by automatic manipulation of the fuel control.As a resuit there is an interdependence the action of the thermostat de pends on the warmth of the room and the room s warth depends on the action of the thermostat.On a more complex level of automatic controls are the analog and digital computers in which whole sequences of instructions are stored on tapes acting as the memories of the electronic brains.

Class Strata Fading He commenced that the general rise in income levels the growth of suburban living and the social intermingling of workers of many types all have contributed to a softening of the sharply defined standards that formerly differentiated these groups and to a general rise in taste standards all along the line. This means he said that the designer today can do a more inspired more tasteful design job and still feel reasonably sure that he will not be designing over the heads of his audience. Among other factors shaping the future of design in this country he listed the influence of foreign concepts and increasing recognition by management that design can be a powerful marketing tool.In his discussion of automation as giving the designer new freedom in creating products for mass output Mr. Margulies included this warning The designer must never compromise his own integrity by designing down to the limitations of the machine.We must be able to look forward to something better than an era of automatic gingerbread.
